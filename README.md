Global Production Dashboard
üöÄ Project Overview

The Global Production Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project designed to monitor real-time production metrics across multiple manufacturing plants. Built with Python, Dash, and Plotly, the dashboard enables data-driven decision-making for process optimization, quality control, and Industry 4.0 initiatives.

The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics, from exploratory data analysis to interactive KPI dashboards, simulating real-world manufacturing operations.

üéØ Business Problem

Manufacturing efficiency and quality control are critical to operational success. Key challenges include:

Monitoring production performance across multiple plants and lines.

Detecting defects and downtime patterns.

Optimizing operational efficiency using actionable insights.

This dashboard provides a centralized view of production KPIs, enabling managers to make timely, informed decisions.

üìä Dataset

Plants: 3 (A, B, C)

Production Lines: 3 per plant

Period: 3 months (hourly data)

Variables: Units Produced, Defects, Downtime, Operator Shift

The dataset is simulated to reflect real-world manufacturing operations and supports KPI calculation and visualization.
